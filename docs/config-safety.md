# Config Safety: User/Agent Workflow

## Problem

AI agents running inside YOLO Jail can edit workspace files, including
`yolo-jail.jsonc`. Without guardrails, an agent could add packages, mounts,
or change security settings without the human operator noticing. The changes
would silently take effect on the next jail restart.

## Design Goals

1. **Agents CAN edit the config** — they need to request packages for their work
2. **Humans MUST approve changes** — no silent config modifications
3. **Agents MUST self-validate edits** — run `yolo check` after every config change
4. **The flow should be natural** — no special commands or flags needed
5. **Non-interactive use should still work** — CI/scripts shouldn't block

## How It Works

### Config Snapshot

On every new jail startup, the CLI compares the current merged config
(user defaults + workspace config) against a snapshot from the previous run:

- **First run**: Config is accepted and a snapshot is saved at
  `<workspace>/.yolo/config-snapshot.json`
- **No changes**: Startup proceeds normally
- **Changes detected**: A unified diff is displayed and the user is prompted
  with `Accept these config changes? [y/N]`

The snapshot stores the **normalized** (parsed and re-serialized) config, so
cosmetic changes like reformatting or reordering comments don't trigger a diff.

### What the User Sees

```
⚠  Jail config changed since last run:

--- previous config
+++ current config
@@ -1,4 +1,7 @@
 {
+  "packages": [
+    "postgresql"
+  ],
   "security": {
     "blocked_tools": [

Accept these config changes? [y/N]
```

### User Responses

- **y/yes**: Changes are accepted, snapshot updated, jail starts
- **N/no/empty**: Changes are rejected, jail does not start. The user can
  inspect and revert the config before trying again.
- **Non-interactive** (piped stdin): Changes are accepted with a warning
  message. This allows CI and scripted workflows to function.

### Reusing Containers

Config approval checks only run when **creating a new container**. When attaching to
an existing running container (`docker exec`), the config is not re-checked
because the container was already started with its config. This is why agents
must run `yolo check` themselves after every config edit, even mid-session.

## Agent Workflow

The intended flow for agents that need additional packages:

1. Agent determines it needs a package (e.g., `postgresql` for database work)
2. Agent edits `/workspace/yolo-jail.jsonc`:
   ```json
   {
     "packages": ["postgresql"]
   }
   ```
   Or for a specific version, using a nixpkgs commit hash:
   ```json
   {
     "packages": [{"name": "freetype", "nixpkgs": "e6f23dc0..."}]
   }
   ```
   Find commits per version at: https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/
3. Agent runs `yolo check` (or `yolo check --no-build` inside a running jail)
   and fixes any reported config/build problems before asking for a restart
4. Agent tells the human: *"I've added `postgresql` to the jail config and ran
   `yolo check`. Please restart the jail so I can use it."*
5. Human exits the jail and runs `yolo` again
6. Human sees the config diff and types `y` to approve
7. Image rebuilds with the new package (takes a minute)
8. Agent can now use `psql` and PostgreSQL tools

### What Agents Should Know

This information is automatically included in the AGENTS.md injected into
every jail. Agents are told:

- They can edit `yolo-jail.jsonc` to add packages
- Package names must match nixpkgs attributes
- They must run `yolo check` after **every** config edit before asking for a restart
- They must ask the human to restart
- They must NOT use apt, nix-env, or other package managers

### Security Properties

- **Human-in-the-loop**: Every config change requires explicit approval
- **Visible diff**: The human sees exactly what changed
- **Reversible**: If rejected, the config file is still modified but the
  jail doesn't start. The human can `git checkout yolo-jail.jsonc` to revert.
- **No privilege escalation**: Packages are nix packages, not arbitrary
  binaries. The nix sandbox ensures reproducibility.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `yolo-jail.jsonc` | Workspace config (project root) |
| `~/.config/yolo-jail/config.jsonc` | User-level defaults |
| `<workspace>/.yolo/config-snapshot.json` | Last-approved normalized config |

## Edge Cases

- **No config file**: Empty config `{}` is snapshotted. Adding a config later
  triggers a diff.
- **User config changes**: Since the snapshot stores the merged result,
  changes to user-level config also trigger a diff.
- **Config deleted**: Triggers a diff (previous config → empty config).
- **Multiple agents**: All share the same config file. If two agents modify
  it, the human sees all changes combined in one diff.
